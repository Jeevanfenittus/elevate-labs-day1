# elevate-labs-day1
* I created a S3 bucket in the name of elevate-labs-intern-day-1
* The region I selected is us-east-1
* i had given the public access to the bucket
* I have written a policy file in json to give permission 
* I created a object in the bucket
* In the bucket, I uploaded a jpeg file offer letter .jpeg
* Anyone can access the file using a Public URL : https://elevate-labs-intern-day-1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/elevate-labs-S3/offer+letter+.jpeg
* I tested it in my browser and shared the screenshot
* As a outcome of the project I Learned about object storage, bucket creation, file upload, and sharing via URL.
