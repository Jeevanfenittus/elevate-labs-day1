# elevate-labs-day1
•	Created an Amazon S3 bucket named elevate-labs-intern-day-1 in the us-east-1 region.
•	Configured the bucket with public access permissions.
•	Wrote a JSON bucket policy to define access permissions for objects.
•	Uploaded a JPEG file named offer letter.jpeg into the folder elevate-labs-S3 within the bucket.
•	Made the file publicly accessible via the following URL:  
     https://elevate-labs-intern-day-1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/elevate-labs-S3/offer+letter+.jpeg
•	Verified the file’s accessibility by testing the link in a browser and capturing a screenshot.
•	Outcome: Learned about object storage, S3 bucket creation, file upload process, and public file sharing using AWS S3.
